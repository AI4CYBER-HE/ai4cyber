# AI4FIDS - Federated Detection of threats 

**AI4FIDS** is a high-performance solution designed to detect a broad spectrum of attacks across **network, host, and log data**.  

Its core feature is **federated learning**, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train an intrusion detection model without sharing their raw data. This preserves data privacy while ensuring collective intelligence.  

The system also supports intrusion detection for application-level communication protocols, including **KNX** and **OCPP**.  

Furthermore, AI4FIDS integrates advanced mechanisms into the training process to:  
- Address client data heterogeneity.  
- Defend against adversarial threats.  
- Ensure robustness of the resulting models against both **statistical distribution shifts** and **adversarial resilience challenges**.

##  Project Structure  

- **StatAvg/**  
  StatAvg was developed in the context of tackling statistical heterogeneity of each nodeâ€™s data, and it is based on providing global statistical parameters, such as mean, std, and variance in order the nodes to uniformly scale their data 

- **N-FIDS/**  
  Network-based Federated Intrusion Detection System.  

- **T4FIDS/**  
  T4FIDS implement the federated training of intrusion detection model, across multiple clients and a  central server. These models are subsequently utilized by AI4FIDS for the forthcoming deteciton of security events  

- **L-FIDS AD Logs/**  
  User behavior anomaly detector based on **Active Directory logs**.
