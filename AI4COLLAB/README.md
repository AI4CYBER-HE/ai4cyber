# AI4COLLAB

AI4COLLAB represents a transformative step forward in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) sharing, seamlessly integrating **MISP** and **OpenCTI** platforms to enable a secure, real-time, and scalable exchange of threat data. Leveraging **Apache Kafka** for high-throughput processing, the platform ensures CTI flows efficiently between stakeholders while complying with **GDPR** and preserving data utility. 
A standout feature of AI4COLLAB is its **advanced anonymization pipeline**, which combines **Microsoft Presidio** with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to automatically detect and redact sensitive information with high accuracy. This robust anonymization capability significantly reduces privacy risks without compromising the value of shared intelligence. By supporting open standards such as **STIX** and **TAXII** and adopting the **SSE protocol** for real-time updates, AI4COLLAB ensures broad interoperability and seamless integration with existing cybersecurity infrastructures.

Designed for cybersecurity providers, enterprise SOCs, and governmental bodies, AI4COLLAB not only strengthens collaborative defense mechanisms but also opens pathways for commercialization through IP protection. The componentâ€™s innovation and impact make it a cornerstone for future-ready, AI-powered CTI ecosystems.
