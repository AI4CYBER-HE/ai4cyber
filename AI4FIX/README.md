# AI4FIX â€“ Vulnerability Fixing  

**AI4FIX** is a fully open-source, end-to-end vulnerability fixing solution supporting **Java**.  

It introduces **automatic unit testing of proposed fixes**, enabling vulnerabilities to be resolved much earlier in the software development lifecycle. By shifting patching upstream, AI4FIX reduces development time, minimizes rework, and improves the security and robustness of applications.
