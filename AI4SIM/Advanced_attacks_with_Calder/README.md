# Caldera-Based Advanced Attack Emulation  

This module leverages **Caldera** to emulate advanced cyberattacks in a controlled environment, supporting the development and validation of defense mechanisms within the project.  

The emulation plans include scenarios inspired by well-known threat actors such as **Wizard Spider** and **Sandworm**, enabling security researchers and SOC teams to test resilience against sophisticated adversaries.
