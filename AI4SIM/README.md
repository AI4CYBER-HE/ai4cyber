# AI4SIM â€“ Threat Simulation  

**AI4SIM** is an advanced cyberattack simulation solution designed to emulate both **traditional** and **AI-powered attacks** across **IT, OT, and IoT systems**, tailored to customer-specific needs.  

It provides a flexible and extensible framework that combines **fuzzing**, **adversarial attack generation**, **AI-driven penetration testing**, and **Caldera-based emulation** to reproduce real-world attack scenarios. These simulations allow organizations to test, validate, and harden their defenses against evolving threats.

##  Project Structure  

- **Smart Network Fuzzer**  
  Network fuzzer leveraging **GANs** and the **MAIP solution** for generating realistic attack traffic.  

- **AI4SIM Dashboard & Reporting**  
  Centralized dashboard to manage dockerized attack technologies and provide reporting across simulations.  

- **AI-based Penetration Testing**  
  Automated penetration attacks using **DeepExploit** and **Shennina**, integrating AI for adaptive exploitation.  

- **Adversarial Attack Generator (AAG)**  
  Framework for generating **white-box and black-box adversarial perturbations** (e.g., FGSM, PGD, C&W, etc.), primarily for evaluating IDS robustness.  

- **KNX Smart Fuzzer**  
  Specialized GAN-based network fuzzer targeting the **KNX protocol**.  

- **LLM-based Attack Generator**  
  Subcomponent (Caldera plugin) automating penetration attacks and threat scenarios using **Large Language Models**.  

- **Advanced Attacks with Caldera**  
  Includes **emulation plans for Wizard Spider and Sandworm** threat groups, enabling red-team style adversary emulation.
