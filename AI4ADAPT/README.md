# AI4ADAPT repositories

AI4ADAPT is a set of tools to train Reinforcement Learning agents to defend real systems under cybersecurity attacks. It is composed of three projects:
- [AI4Adapt](./AI4Adapt/): the framework to create the agents to be trained
- [AI4Adapt_Env](./AI4Adapt_Env): the abstraction/conversion from virtual environments into physical environments   
- [AI4Adapt_Env_Client](./AI4Adapt_Env_Client): A further layer of security to prevent attacks into the environment to escape from it and damage the training infrastructure
