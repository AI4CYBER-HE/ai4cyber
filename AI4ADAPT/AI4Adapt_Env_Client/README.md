This is a proxy to the `currently private` repository at [AI4ADAPT_env_client](https://github.com/ax1/ai4adapt_env_client).

To perform full safe training, the environment was split into outside world and inside world, thus isolating agents to be damaged by the environment. This is the case where the real system is exposed to potential hackers, viruses, etc. In this case, even if the real system is compromised, the Reinforcement learning agent remains safe because the attacker cannot manipulate the agent.

In other cases where the experiments are controlled, both applications AI4ADAPT_env_client and AI4ADAPT_env_client can be merged into a single environment.

For more information, we recommend start browsing to the [AI4ADAPT](https://github.com/ax1/ai4adapt) repository, where more documentation, diagrams, and useful links are provided.
