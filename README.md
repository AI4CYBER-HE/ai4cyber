# AI4CYBER Project Repository

## Introduction
This repository hosts the **main codebase and tools of the AI4CYBER Horizon Europe project**.  
AI4CYBER focuses on advancing cybersecurity through **AI-driven methods** for threat detection, response, resilience, and trust assurance.  
The project delivers innovative components across intrusion detection, threat intelligence sharing, adversarial robustness, vulnerability assessment, explainability, and trust in AI.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into dedicated components:

- **AI4ADAPT** – Optimizer of incident response adaptation  
- **AI4COLLAB** – An AI-based Threat Information Sharing Platform   
- **AI4CTI** – An LLM-based CTI aggregator   
- **AI4DECEIVE** – Honeynet deployment platform 
- **AI4FIDS** – An AI-based Federated Intrusion Detection System  
- **AI4FIX** – An AI-driven vulnerability fixing and code repair  
- **AI4SIM** – Simulation and emulation environment for AI4CYBER components 
- **AI4SOAR** - An AI-powered Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response. 
- **AI4TRIAGE** – AI-powered Cybersecurity Alert Triage and Root-Cause Analysis Tool   
- **AI4VULN** – An AI enhanced vulnerability detector   
- **TRUST4AI.Fairness** – Ensuring fairness in AI-based cybersecurity models  
- **TRUST4AI.Security** – Security testing of AI systems  
- **TRUST4AI.XAI** - Explainable AI 

Each folder contains a **README.md** with a description of each component/subcomponent and links for its one.

## License
This repository contains a mix of **open-source** and **prototype modules**.  
Some components are available under **open-source licenses** (e.g., Apache-2.0), while others are currently research prototypes.
