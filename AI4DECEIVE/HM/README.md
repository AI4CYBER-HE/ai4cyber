# Montimage Monitoring Tool (MMT)  

The **Montimage Monitoring Tool (MMT)** is being extended within the **AI4CYBER** project to process and extract knowledge from the logs of honeypots required by the projectâ€™s use cases.  

By enhancing MMT with AI4CYBER capabilities, the tool can analyze honeypot data streams more effectively, providing valuable insights into malicious behaviors, intrusion attempts, and emerging attack patterns. This enables better situational awareness and strengthens the overall cyber defense ecosystem.
