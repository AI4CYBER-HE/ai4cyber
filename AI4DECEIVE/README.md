# AI4DECEIVE â€“ Deception and honeypots

The intelligent deception mechanisms that will enrich the response of the AI4SOAR.

---

##  Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Intelligent Deceive Decision Engine  (IDDE)**  
  Module responsible for the definition of the honeynet deployment policy. The IDDE is based on Game Theory modelling and uses attack information from the MMT to compute the number and types of honeypot instances    that should be deployed as countermeasures to attacks. 

- **Honeypot Management (HM)**  
  The asset is capable of handling honeypot deployment policies combining local and Cloud instances. The honeypots catalogue has been expanded, and connectivity with other components has been improved. 

- **MMT**  
  The MMT is being extended in AI4CYBER to be able to process and extract knowledge from the logs of the honeypots required by the use cases of the project
